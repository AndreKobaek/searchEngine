\section{Improved Client GUI}
Inspired by the recently completed World Chess Championship and our group name, IPM (abbreviation of Introductory Programming, group M), being a pun on IBM. We decided to implement a visual style honouring the late, great chess computer, Deep Blue.

The site has a simple mobile-first layout. A dynamic background resembling the inner workings of a sophisticated AI fills the screen. In front are simple form elements with a retro, monospace font. A search is carried out both when clicking on the button and when pressing \textit{Enter} while focus is in the search field. When a search has been completed, a few details are displayed: The amount of websites retrieved, the time it took, and a tip of the hat to Garry Kasparov. Below, results are displayed with a simple preview.
