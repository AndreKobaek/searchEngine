\section{Refined Queries}

\subsection{Basic Input Validation}
Initially, we added simple input validation to [QueryHandler] to only accept queries comprised of characters in the English alphabet, digits, dashes and underscores. This was done using the following regular expression: %[\\b([-\\w]+)\\b]
Additionally, query strings are transformed to lowercase using [.toLowerCase()] before doing a lookup.
