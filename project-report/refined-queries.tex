\section{Refined Queries}

Already during the implementation of the inverted index, we add simple input validation to \code{QueryHandler} to only accept queries comprised of characters in the English alphabet, digits, dashes and underscores. This is done using the following regular expression: \code{[\\\\b([-\\\\w]+)\\\\b]}. Additionally, query strings are transformed to lowercase using before doing a lookup.

For the refined queries, we build upon this functionality.

\subsection{Multiple Words}
First off, we add logic to handle multiple words in a search query. Since we utilise \code{Pattern} and \code{Matcher}, the procedure is quite simple: If there is more than one match, the results from the first lookup is stored in a list and the results from the following lookups are retained from the same list. After the final lookup, the list is returned.

Tests for the implementation are located in \code{QueryHandlerTest.java}
