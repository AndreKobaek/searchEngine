In order to ensure proper quality of the individual code files and the system as a whole, we utilise different dynamic techniques.

\section{Code Review}
We decided to pair programming as much as possible due to its many benefits and due to the fact the the usual drawbacks of the technique not being present.
Pair programming is a strong tool to ensure that the code produced is of high quality. The pair will discus the design and meta decisions on the fly, as well as being able to catch potential typos and blunders in the actual implementation. Additionally, pair programming prevents disruption of the group's work flow in the case a member is unavailable, as two members will be familiar with the same sections of the code. The drawback of pair programming is usually the lost man hours, but these are essentially either turned into insurance of work continuity or time saved bug fixing.

\section{Version Control and Git Work Flow}
Keeping track of changes is essential. We decided upon a simplified version of Gitflow including a master and develop branch as well as individual feature branches. This allowed us to keep distinct releases separate from the latest work and ongoing experiments. For the scope of this project, we deemed release and hotfix branches unnecessary.
