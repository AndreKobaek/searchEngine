This report presents the search engine project we developed during the last four weeks of the course Introductory Programming.

In section 2-3, we present general considerations regarding software design and quality. Section 4 contains walkthroughs for the mandatory tasks, and section 5 contains walkthroughs for the extensions. The different versions are marked by git tags.
In particular, we implemented an improved GUI, learnt about clustering by developing the k-means algorithm, made elegant use of regular expressions in an URL filter, and delved into fuzzy searching.
\\

The core of the project was based on the topics we studied in the Introductory Programming course, but during some of the tasks we have also been utilising  knowledge and tools acquired in the Discrete Mathematics course as well as the Software Engineering course.
This mix gave us the possibility to strengthen and consolidate our knowledge about the topics we studied in this semester.
\subsection{Work Distribution}
The workload has generally been evenly distributed amongst the authors. However, the extensions were mainly developed by individuals. Author information is included in the \code{Javadoc}.
