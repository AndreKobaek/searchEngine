\section{Introduction}
This report is meant to present the project we implemented in the last four weeks of the course in Introductionary Programming. During this time we have been challenged with different aspects of designing an application. 

We implemented the mandatory tasks as well as the extensions all together, using this opportunity to learn from each other. Every member of the group made available his compentences for the project. These competences came from different backgrounds and mixed together they allowed us to dive deep into the project reaching our goals in time with the schedule. This cohesiveness among the members allowed us to carry out different extensions. In particular we implemented an improved GUI, learnt about clustering by developing the k-means algorithm, made elegant use of regular expression in the  URL Filter, and the fuzzy search extensions.

The core of the project was based on the topics we studied in the Introductionary Programming course, but during some of the tasks we have been using also knowledge and tools aquired into the Discrete Mathematics course as well as the Software Engineering course.

This mix gave us the possibility to strengthen and consolidate our knowledge about the topics we studied in the last semester.
